 Blockchain-based-certificate-verification-system

Introduction

EduChain is a decentralized, tamper-proof platform designed to tackle the growing problem of academic certificate fraud. By leveraging a custom-built blockchain, this system enables real-time, transparent, and secure verification of academic credentials. The project serves both as a practical solution for institutions and recruiters, and as an educational tool for understanding core blockchain concepts.

Architecture Overview

EduChain follows a **three-tier architecture** with modular components:

Frontend
- **Languages Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Features:**
  - Add Certificate Page: For institutions to issue new certificates
  - Verify Certificate Page: For public users/employers to verify authenticity
  - Responsive Design: Uses Flexbox and Grid for adaptable layouts
  - Real-time API calls via `fetch()` for dynamic content rendering
 
    Backend (API Server)
- **Tech Stack:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Manage blockchain logic (block creation, hashing, validation)
  - Handle HTTP requests for issuing and verifying certificates
  - Provide secure endpoints with JWT token authentication
  - Enable CORS for frontend-backend communication
 
  - Blockchain Core
- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Custom Implementation:**
  - `Block` and `Blockchain` classes
  - SHA256 hashing for data integrity
  - Proof-of-Work algorithm to prevent spam/fraud
  - Chain validation using `isChainValid()`

###  Docker (Optional for Deployment)
- Lightweight containerized setup using `node:alpine`
- Ensures environment consistency across machines
- Deployed via `docker build` and `docker run`

- Network Users

1. **Admin/Institution Representatives**
   - Issue valid certificates to students
   - Log in securely via JWT-authenticated dashboard
   - Access restricted features like revoking certificates

2. **Employers / Verifiers**
   - Enter certificate ID or scan QR code to verify authenticity
   - No login required; read-only access

3. **Students**
   - Receive tamper-proof digital certificates
   - Can share or download certificates with embedded QR verification
  
   - Getting Started

###  Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- npm v6+
- Docker (optional)
- Web browser (Chrome/Firefox)
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)


 Testing & Results
Tampering tests confirmed 100% detection success rate

Real-time verification from frontend to blockchain

Load tested with 1,000+ concurrent certificate verifications
